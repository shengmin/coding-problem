Meeting Point (50 Points)
 
There is an infinite integer grid at which N people have their houses on. They decide to unite at a common meeting place, which is someone's house. 
From any given cell, all 8 adjacent cells are reachable in 1 unit of time. 
eg: (x,y) can be reached from (x-1,y+1) in a single unit of time.
Find a common meeting place which minimises the sum of the travel times of all the persons.

Input Format:
N
The following N lines will contain two integers saying the x & y coordinate of the i-th person.

Output Format:
M M = min sum of all travel times; 


Constraints:
N <= 10^5
The absolute value of each co-ordinate in the input will be atmost 109


HINT: Please use long long 64-bit integers;

Input #00:
4
